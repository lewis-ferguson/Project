I'd like you to make a readme.md file in your project and start filling that out. It's like a text file, but you can use markdown or HTML to format it a little more nicely. One of the project requirements is to have detailed planning, wireframes, a list of ways your site follows accessibility guidelines, and a list of the SEO and UX principles that were considered. These should be covered in your readme file. You can add a screenshots or images directory to your project and include pictures of any planning (personas/wireframes etc) you have used, and you can display them in the readme file using markdown. If you're not sure about how to do this let me know and we can go over it. :D
