<!-- I'd like you to make a readme.md file in your project and start filling that out. It's like a text file, but you can use markdown or HTML to format it a little more nicely. One of the project requirements is to have detailed planning, wireframes, a list of ways your site follows accessibility guidelines, and a list of the SEO and UX principles that were considered. These should be covered in your readme file. You can add a screenshots or images directory to your project and include pictures of any planning (personas/wireframes etc) you have used, and you can display them in the readme file using markdown. If you're not sure about how to do this let me know and we can go over it. :D -->

-Title : Bucket List Travels

The aim of the website is to allow users to sign up and receieve information on package holidays, and to find out information on which holidays they would like to know more about.
The web pages were created using html and styled using css.

I used figma to create a vector graphic to use as my logo in the main header of each web page, and a tree and beach ball in the footer of the pages.
CSS was used along with a vector graphic to create the waves animation.
Javascript was used as responsive feedback to let the users know which locations they selected when filling out the form.
CSS was also used to make the pictures interactive when you mouse over, giving information about each country on mouseover.


The project can be pulled from github and run using the terminal with ' npm run server:dev ', or it can be run using live server on visual studio code.

<!-- -Include wireframes used and any personas used to help create yoyr website. --> -->
To keep track of tasks that I had to complete, I used trello to break down tasks into 'to do', 'doing' and 'done' to keep the project a lot more organised.

I initially drew wireframes on paper and used figma and excilidraw to finalise them.

<!-- SEO principles - 
Keywords used?
Page loading - it needs to be fast, what have you used to make the page fast. e.g images as close to resoultion as possible to reduce load time
Are the pages visually stable.
Have you optimised URLs? -->

SEO and UX principles:
The website contains a link to another travelling website. https://thebucketlistcompany.co.uk/
I chose images as close to the resolution I was using as possible to optimise loading time on the web page.
The URL's are kept very simple for easy navigation.

<!-- Meta tags?
Keywords? -->


<!-- UX and accessibility-
Dyslexia friendly font?  -->
I have used Trebuchet MS for all font contained on the website as it is dyslexia friendly.
The website can be easily navigated using keyboard.
The website is perceivable, the images all have alt tags incase the images do not load
The website is understandable, It has clear and concise information that can be easily understood.
The website has been made with contrasting text and background colours so it is easily readable.

<!-- Enough contrast between text and background.
Appropriate header tags. html and content side.
Have you made sure there are no broken links?
Have you avoided things like auto playing videos,pop ups and large file sizes?
